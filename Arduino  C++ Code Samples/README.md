# Arduino/C++ Code Samples
Examples of the implementation of C++ language for developing hardware using the Arduino platform.

Most of these examples have the only purpose to communicate with interfaces in other languages.
Thus the scripts focus on detecting simple real-world Inputs and translating them into integers to be analyzed by another device.

*(2014) Arduino_Program_Concurrent: Translates Digital Inputs and sennds them through the serial port.

*(2015) Arduino_Program_Photocell_Concurrent: Translates Analog Inputs and sends them through the serial port.

*(2017) BT_ Configurador: Allows the user to change the configuration of an HC-05 Bluetooth module.

*(2018) Green_Light: Using Adafruit Neopixel and presure sensitive sensors changes the light pattern to indicate different status changes.

*(2018) Guante_NRH_ANG :  Translates different kinds of Inputs concatenate them in a string tailored for communication with Unity by adjusting parameters on the other side of the interface.
