Carlos Perez Code Samples

This repository serves as a portfolio of different pieces of code written by Carlos Perez.
The repository contains:

*A Visual Basic-Arduino interface designed to record lever presses on operant chambers.

*My licensure thesis with the code written in Java in order to create a mobile interface intended for use as a teaching tool in behavior analysis courses.

*A Jupyter notebook of a course on the use of Python for Data Analysis.

*Arduino/C++ simple programs implemented for creating wearable devices that read real-world data and interface with smart devices.

*Isolated C# code samples that use different algorithms to tailored better virtual experiences using real worlds sensors.

*The full collection of the C# scripts used in a simple 2.5D platformer game using the UNITY game engine.
