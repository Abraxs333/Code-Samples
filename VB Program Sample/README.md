# Visual Basic Program Sample
*(2012) Ratuino PC: This is the first software I ever created.
The Interface communicates with an Arduino based device to detect real-world lever presses of rats in operant chambers.
The VB side of the interface analyzes the real-world data in order to determine when and how to deliver stimuli.
All the basic schedules of reinforcement are implemented in the interface. The version included in this repository is the latest version created for the final acceptance of a 2015 scientific journal publication.

Most of the algorithms are contained in the session.vb file.
