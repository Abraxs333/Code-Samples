# Unity C# Scripts
*(2020) This folder holds all the scripts used for a basic 2.5D platformer game.

These Scripts differ from other C# Scripts in the repository in the sense that they are meant to be used within the Unity environment.
While other scripts clearly define references and variables. With the use of the Unity Engine, most of the game logic can be created and modified without the use of code.

Thus, these scripts are meant to highlight the ability to tailor my style of coding to a specific environment.
