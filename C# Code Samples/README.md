# C# Code Samples
Examples of the implementation of C# language for approaching different tasks.
Most of these examples focus on implementing real-world physical movement data as inputs for virtual worlds.

*(2018) AR Footwear: Communicates with 2 different wearable devices through BT and translates the data on a single input. Low latency, package loss, and desynchronization were addressed to improve efficiency.

*(2017) Kinect Angles: Simple code to determine the angle between two joints using the Kinect sensor. 

*(2017) Player Controller: First attempt at a player controller for a 2d platformer. (Later I learned about all the components that Unity gives the creators to easily make player controllers).

*(2018) Calibration: The script uses measures of central tendency to calibrate sensors that are not very precise. Thus stabilizing the data input.

*(2019) Input Manager: Simple input Manager for detecting a broad range of Inputs such as Kinect, gamepads, keyboard, touchscreen, and different custom made wearable devices.

*(2020)PowerUp: Simple script for determining which type of power-up should be implemented in a videogame.
